# tsql
A stupid stupid twitter client that uses sql commands to get tweets. Did I mention that this is totally stupid?

`node tsql.js select text, created_at from gilmae`

TODO
* Parse WHERE clauses into timeline filters
* Table joining
* Some sort of keyword for just bringing back the standard authenticated user's timeline
* Ordering other than descending order
* I don't know, a reason to be beyond far too much effort (30 minutes!) poured into a lol
